# Dropshipping Application

Our project is part of the Softuni initiative, providing students with an opportunity to work on a project that closely resembles real-world applications.

This project is managed by [Deyan Danailov](https://github.com/DeyanDanailov) and developed by [Rosen Dobrev](https://github.com/RosenDobrev10), [Todor Yadkov](https://github.com/TodorYadkov) and [Maxim Kraychev](https://github.com/maximkraychev).
