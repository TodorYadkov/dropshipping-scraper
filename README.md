# Dropshipping Application

Our project is part of the Softuni initiative, providing students with an opportunity to work on a project that closely resembles real-world applications.

This project is managed by [Deyan Danailov](https://github.com/DeyanDanailov) and developed by [Rosen Dobrev](https://github.com/RosenDobrev10), [Todor Yadkov](https://github.com/TodorYadkov) and [Maxim Kraychev](https://github.com/maximkraychev).

It is designed after several years of experience in maintaining and developing custom software in the sphere. The Dropshipping Software System comprises three essential components that work together seamlessly to enhance your dropshipping experience.
