# Dropshipping Software System

Our project is part of the Softuni initiative, providing students with an opportunity to work on a project that closely resembles real-world applications. 

This project is managed by [Deyan Danailov](https://github.com/DeyanDanailov) and developed by [Rosen Dobrev](https://github.com/RosenDobrev10), [Todor Yadkov](https://github.com/TodorYadkov) and [Maxim Kraychev](https://github.com/maximkraychev).

## Project Overview

The main purpose of the system is to automate, organize and put to a whole new level the dropshipping experience. It is designed after several years of experience in maintaining and developing custom software in the sphere. The Dropshipping Software System comprises three essential components that work together seamlessly to enhance your dropshipping experience.

## Components:

### Browser Extension

The Browser Extension is the first pillar of our system. It acts as a virtual dropshipping assistant, scraping crucial information from Amazon and Ebay. It maintains constant communication with a central server, ensuring that the data it collects remains up-to-date. Whether it's prices, product availability, or other vital details, this extension has you covered.

### API Server

The API Server is the heart of our project. Powered by Node.js and Express.js, it serves as the backbone, facilitating communication between the Browser Extension, the website, and our robust database.

### Website

The Website is your control center for managing your dropshipping business. It provides real-time information about the products you've chosen to track, ensuring you're always in the loop. You can effortlessly add new products for monitoring by sharing their Amazon URLs. Our site features an array of filters, user account management, and a permissions system, all designed to enhance your user experience.
