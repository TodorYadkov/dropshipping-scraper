## Chrome Extension

The Chrome Extension is the first pillar of our system, acting as a virtual dropshipping assistant. It specializes in scraping crucial information from Amazon and eBay, ensuring that you have access to up-to-date data. The extension maintains constant communication with a central server to provide real-time information, covering essential details such as prices, product availability and more.

## Installation

1. Download the extension from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TodorYadkov/dropshipping-scraper/releases/latest/download/extension.zip).
2. Extract the extension files into a folder of your choice.<br/> **Note:** Do not delete this folder after the extraction, it is essential for the extension to function correctly.
3. Open [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable "Developer mode."
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you extracted the extension files.

## Usage

The extension offers key functionalities related to authentication and control:

- **Login:** Users can log in using their email, extension name, and password.
- **Logout:** Users can logout.
- **Start Extension:** Initiate the scraping process.
- **Stop Extension:** Halt the scraping process.
